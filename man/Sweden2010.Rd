\description{
The \code{Sweden2010} dataset contains data from the 2010 Swedish Parliamentary Candidate Survey, conducted by the Swedish
public broadcasting network Sveriges Television (SVT). The survey targeted all 5,627 parliamentary candidates, with
completed interviews from 2,830 candidates, including 289 of the 349 candidates who were elected.
}
\details{
Candidates were asked 50 Likert-type questions, using a 4-point scale (from "strongly disagree" to "strongly agree") to register
their opinions on a series of policy statements. Most issue scales focus on economic/social welfare issues, but questions related
to foreign policy, social/cultural matters, law and order, immigration, and environmental issues are also included.
Missing responses are coded as 8.
