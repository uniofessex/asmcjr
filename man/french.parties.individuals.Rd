\details{
The French module of the 2009 EES asked 1,000 respondents to place eight major political parties on a ten-point left-right ideological scale.
This dataset, \code{french.parties.individuals}, contains those placements. In Chapter 2, these placements were scaled directly to compare the results
obtained from scaling different forms of data from the same set of observations.

In addition to directly scaling respondents' placements, each set of placements can be arranged into a similarities matrix for further analysis.
