\title{Bootstrapped Blackbox Analysis Output}
\format{
A list containing the results of the bootstrapped Blackbox analysis.
}
\source{
Generated by the \code{boot.blackbox} function.
}
\usage{
outbb
}
\description{
The \code{outbb} object contains the results of a bootstrapped Blackbox analysis performed on the \code{issues.sweden} dataset. The analysis was conducted using the \code{boot.blackbox} function with specific parameters for handling missing data, dimensionality, scaling, and stimulus positioning.
}
\details{
The object also includes the \code{prerun} output, which provides preliminary diagnostics and summary statistics prior to the bootstrapping process.

The \code{outbb} object captures the outputs from the bootstrapped analysis, including estimated dimensions, scaling factors, and the placement of stimuli. The \code{prerun} output embedded within \code{outbb} contains initial diagnostics that help in assessing the quality and stability of the analysis before bootstrapping is applied.
