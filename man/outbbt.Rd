\title{Bootstrapped Blackbox Transpose Analysis Output}
\format{
A list containing several components, typically including:
\describe{
\item{boot_samples}{A list of bootstrapped samples, each containing the results of the Blackbox transpose analysis for a specific bootstrap iteration.}
\item{original_fit}{The original fit of the Blackbox transpose analysis without bootstrapping.}
\item{convergence}{Convergence diagnostics for each bootstrapped sample, indicating how well the bootstrapping process converged for the specified dimensions.}
\item{errors}{Error metrics or diagnostics generated during the bootstrapping process.}
\item{summary}{A summary of the bootstrapped analysis, including averaged results and variability across bootstrapped samples.}
}
}
\source{
Generated by the \code{boot.blackbox_transpose} function applied to the \code{rankings} dataset.
}
\usage{
outbbt
}
\description{
The \code{outbbt} object contains the results of a bootstrapped Blackbox transpose analysis performed on the \code{rankings} dataset. This analysis was conducted to explore the dimensional structure of the data, handling specified missing values, and applying dimensionality reduction with bootstrapping.
}
\details{
The \code{outbbt} object is generated by performing a bootstrapped Blackbox transpose analysis on the \code{rankings} dataset, with dimensionality reduction to 3 dimensions. Missing data values specified as \code{77}, \code{88}, and \code{89} were handled during the analysis. The process was repeated \code{R=5} times to generate a robust estimate of the dimensional structure of the data.
