\description{
This dataset contains the agreement score matrix of the 90th US Senate, covering the years 1967-1968.
The dataset includes 102 legislators: 100 Senators, President Lyndon Johnson (who "voted" on select bills by announcing a position),
and Senator Charles Goodell (R-NY), who replaced Senator Robert F. Kennedy after his assassination in June 1968.
}
\details{
The matrix is used to analyze the dimensions of voting behavior in the Senate during this period, with
two primary dimensions identified: liberal-conservative and region/civil-rights.
The data were used in the analysis by Poole and Rosenthal (1997).
