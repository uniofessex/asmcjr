\description{
The \code{nation} dataset contains similarity ratings between twelve nations, as collected by Wish (1971).
In 1968, Wish asked 18 students in his psychological measurement class to rate the perceived similarity between each pair of twelve nations using a 9-point scale,
where '1' indicates "very different" and '9' indicates "very similar". The data in this dataset represent the average similarity ratings between these nations.
}
\details{
The \code{nations} dataset was constructed by averaging the similarity ratings provided by 18 students in Wish's 1968 psychological measurement class.
The dataset is a symmetric matrix where both the rows and columns represent the twelve nations, and each cell contains the average similarity rating
between the corresponding pair of nations.
