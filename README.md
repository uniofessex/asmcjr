This package supports the book [“2nd Edition: Analyzing Spatial Models
of Choice and
Judgment”](https://www.routledge.com/Analyzing-Spatial-Models-of-Choice-and-Judgment/II-Bakker-Carroll-Hare-Poole-Rosenthal/p/book/9781138715332).
In this second edition, much of the R code has been streamlined. The
package contains all of the data and functions necessary to replicate
the analyses presented in the book.
