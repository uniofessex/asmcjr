## 4.2 Metric Unfolding Using the MLSMU6 Procedure
#### 4.2.1 Example 1: 1981 Interest Group Ratings of US Senators Data

```{r}
library(asmcjr)
library(asmcjr)
data(interest1981)
```

The data interest1981 are arranged such that the individuals (Senators) are on the rows and the stimuli (the interest groups) are on the columns. The interest group ratings themselves are stored in columns 9-38, which we assign to the matrix input. 
```{r}
# Convert selected columns (9 to 38) from the dataframe to a matrix
input <- as.matrix(interest1981[, 9:38])

# Set a cutoff threshold for the number of non-missing values required per row
cutoff <- 5

# Filter the rows to keep only those with at least 'cutoff' non-missing values
input <- input[rowSums(!is.na(input)) >= cutoff, ]

# Normalize the data by subtracting from 100 and dividing by 50
input <- (100 - input) / 50

# Square the normalized data
input2 <- input * input

# Replace NA values in the squared data with the square of the mean of non-NA values
input2[is.na(input)] <- (mean(input, na.rm = TRUE))^2
```

use double-centering to get good starting values for the MLSMU6 algorithm. 

```{r}
inputDC <- doubleCenterRect(input2)
```

In order to obtain the starting coordinates for the stimuli (stims) and individuals (inds), we perform singular value decomposition on the double-centered matrix using the base function svd.
```{r}
# Perform Singular Value Decomposition (SVD) on the input matrix
xsvd <- svd(inputDC)

# Set the number of dimensions to retain
ndim <- 2

# Extract the first 'ndim' right singular vectors (stimuli) and left singular vectors (individuals)
stims <- xsvd$v[, 1:ndim]
inds <- xsvd$u[, 1:ndim]

# Adjust the singular vectors by multiplying by the square root of the corresponding singular values
for (i in 1:ndim) {
  stims[,i] <- stims[,i] * sqrt(xsvd$d[i])
  inds[,i] <- inds[,i] * sqrt(xsvd$d[i])
}
```

`MLSMU6` converges on the result for the 1981 interest group data in 12 iterations, reducing the sum of squared errors to 194.132 (this information is stored in the iter element of the returned results from the mlsmu6 procedure).
```{r}
out <- mlsmu6(input = interest1981[,9:38], ndim=2, cutoff=5,
              id=factor(interest1981$party, labels=c("D", "R")))
tail(out$iter)
```

## 4.3 Metric Unfolding Using Majorization (SMACOF)

# Treat specific values (77, 88, 89) as missing values and replace them with NA
input.den[input.den == 77 | input.den == 88 | input.den == 89] <- NA

# Transform the voting propensity ratings into distances. The ratings are on a 0-10 scale,
# so they are subtracted from 10 and divided by 5, resulting in distances ranging from 0 to 2.

# Set a cutoff value to filter respondents who provided at least 5 party ratings
cutoff <- 5
input.den <- input.den[rowSums(!is.na(input.den)) >= cutoff,]
